<h1 align="center">🖊 Education</h1>

<p align=left>
Computer Engineering @ Polytechnical University of Turin.

Raised with a background in the humanities but always in love with computers and video games, I'm now into the science behind programming, game development, and software development. I love experimenting and understanding how things work "behind the scenes". I'm currently studying object-oriented programming and completing my Bachelor's degree, while I'm looking for an internship that will allow me to grow, challenge myself, and turn my passion into a career.
